        <h2> Bio </h2>

        <p> Hi! I'm Taylor, a passionate gamer and aspiring game developer with a deep 
            love for immersive worlds and creative storytelling. My journey started
            with Lara Croft and SWAT turn based combat with my dad, which fueled
            my curiosity for game design and development. Over time, I've explored level
            design, UI and front end Web Development to bring my game-inspired ideas to life.
            Some of my recent projects include: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Angry Kat! - A remake of Flappy Bird in the form of a 
                angry flying cat with Dragon Ball Z inspired hair!
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Game Dev Blog - A personal site documenting my progress in game
                development and web design.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li> Portfolio Website - An interactive, gamme themed web porfolio built
                with HTML and CSS
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Currently, I'm expanding my skills in web development to creative
        visually engaging interactive expereinces that reflect my passioante
        for gaming. Whether im coding or gaming, I'm always looking to learn
        and create something exciting.

        Lets connect and build something amazing together!

        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <p>I've honed my skills throuhg Udemy C++ courses, diving into the 
            fundamentals of game programming data structures, and perfomance
            optimization. With Unity I've worked on various projects, experimenting with
            physics-based mechanics, UI/UX design and scripting interactive 
            experiences in C#. Additionally, my exploration of Unreal Engine 5 has
            allowed me to experiment with cutting-edge features such as 
            real-time rendering, Blueprints and open-world level design.
